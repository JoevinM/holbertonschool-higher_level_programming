## Table of Tasks

| #  | Task name                       | Description                                                                 | File                           |
|----|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0  | Safe list printing              | Function that prints `x` elements of a list. Returns the number of elements printed. | `0-safe_print_list.py`         |
| 1  | Safe printing of an integer     | Function that prints an integer with `{:d}` format safely. Returns True if the value is an integer, False otherwise. | `1-safe_print_integer.py`      |
| 2  | Print and count integers        | Function that prints the first `x` elements of a list, only integers. Returns the number of integers printed. | `2-safe_print_list_integers.py` |
| 3  | Integers division with debug    | Function that divides 2 integers and prints the result inside a `finally` block. Returns the result of division or None. | `3-safe_print_division.py`     |
| 4  | Divide a list                   | Function that divides element by element two lists, handling exceptions gracefully. Returns a new list with all divisions. | `4-list_division.py`           |
| 5  | Raise exception                 | Function that raises a `TypeError` exception.                               | `5-raise_exception.py`         |
| 6  | Raise a message                 | Function that raises a `NameError` with a custom message.                   | `6-raise_exception_msg.py`     |

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What’s the difference between errors and exceptions  
- What are exceptions and how to use them  
- When do we need to use exceptions  
- How to correctly handle an exception  
- What’s the purpose of catching exceptions  
- How to raise a built-in exception  
- When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`  
- All files should end with a new line  
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory  
- Your code should use **pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)**  
- All files must be executable  
- File length will be tested using `wc`
