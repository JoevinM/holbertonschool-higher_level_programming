| #  | Task name                        | Description                                                       | File                           |
|----|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0  | Print a list of integers         | Function that prints all integers of a list                       | `0-print_list_integer.py`      |
| 1  | Secure access to an element      | Function that retrieves an element from a list                    | `1-element_at.py`              |
| 2  | Replace element                  | Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position| `2-replace_in_list.py`         |
| 3  | Print a list in reverse          | Function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order      | `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` |

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What are lists and how to use them  
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists  
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them  
- How to use lists as stacks and queues  
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them  
- What are tuples and how to use them  
- When to use tuples versus lists  
- What is a sequence  
- What is tuple packing  
- What is sequence unpacking  
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it
