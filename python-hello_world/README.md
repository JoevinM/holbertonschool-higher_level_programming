## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:  

- Use the Python interpreter.  
- Print text and variables using `print()`.  
- Work with strings, indexing, and slicing.  
- Understand Python coding style (PEP8 / Pycodestyle).  

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- All scripts must be executable and include the shebang: `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- Pycodestyle should be used to check coding style.  
- Files should follow the line length and formatting rules provided by Holberton.
