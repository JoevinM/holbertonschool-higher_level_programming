## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What are sets and how to use them  
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them  
- When to use sets versus lists  
- How to iterate into a set  
- What are dictionaries and how to use them  
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets  
- What is a key in a dictionary  
- How to iterate over a dictionary  
- What is a lambda function  
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions  

---

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`  
- All files should end with a new line  
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory  
- Your code should use **pycodestyle (version 2.7.\*)**  
- All files must be executable  
- File length will be tested using `wc`
